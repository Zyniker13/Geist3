# Status

Updated after every working session.

- **Current milestone:** M1 (Linux collectors and basic TUI).
- **Last done:** m1-ci-smoke: `ztop replay <fixture-dir>` parses a recorded capture and renders one 80x24 frame through the production draw path (decision 0008); an integration test renders both committed fixtures and checks the header, the process count and every scrubbed process name; the smoke stage replays both fixtures on every push and the record workflow self-tests each freshly scrubbed fixture before committing it; real-host frames recorded under `docs/screenshots/` (`24d604a`, `857dbe9`).
- **Next step:** m1-close: verify the M1 "Done when" lines against ROADMAP.md, update parity.md, push and confirm CI green on both platforms.
- **Blocked on:** nothing.

## Log

Newest first. One or two lines per session: what changed, what is next.

- m1-ci-smoke done: `ztop replay` renders a recorded fixture through the same `draw` the live TUI uses, so no terminal is needed — the local gate replays both fixtures on every push, the record workflow self-tests each freshly scrubbed fixture before committing it, and real-host frames are recorded in `docs/screenshots/`. Next: close M1.
- m1-tui done: header meters (title, per-core gauges, memory/swap gauges, load, uptime) over a sortable process table; the render path is a pure function of UI state, so snapshot tests at 80x24 and 200x50 run without a pty, and a `--ignored` dump test prints the frame for a human eye. Wired into `ztop` behind a Linux/macOS split (Linux live collector, otherwise an unavailable placeholder).
- m1-collectors done: parsers live in a pure text module so the identical code runs on every machine; fixture integration tests pin every parsed field against both recorded captures (hostnames, 4 cores, 12 processes, disk/net counters); synthetic unit tests cover sensors (absent from the recorded hosts); the cross-target clippy gate caught three compile bugs in the Linux-only live collector before push. Next: the first TUI.
- m1-fixtures done: the job-summary transfer failed (summaries are absent from the check-run API and the job HTML), so the record workflow now scrubs and commits fixtures directly (`scripts/scrub-fixture.py`); two rounds of scrub bugs (per-pid `stat` fell outside the trim, then its gate) were caught by auditing the committed bytes; fixtures from both runners are 60 entries, all process names faked, fixed files verbatim. Next: Linux collectors against these fixtures.
- M0 closed: CI green on both platforms after fixing a Linux-only compile error and a wrong expected string in a Linux-only test (found through the new CI annotations check.sh emits on failure). Next: M1.
- M0 built: stack decisions 0002–0006, the workspace skeleton (core, tui, agent, hub, ztop), architecture/threat-model/security/contributing docs, ZTopKit and the app skeleton, the fixture format and `ztop capture`.
- Project defined (DESIGN.md, ROADMAP.md, docs/parity.md, AGENTS.md; MIT OR Apache-2.0). Next: M0.
